Welcome to Week 1
Aims:
- Reviews FNN/ CNN <-> modular code.
- Learning to use *packaging* (multi-file, import, CLI), for a big project

Smaller Tasks (If you need):
- Clone a template repo (Poetry/pipenv, pre-commit).
  - However, I prefer using conda due to its convenient, and easily to manage global packages. Then I just need to define environment.yml. 
- Review FFN, CNN by building a simple project classify MNIST data. 
  - Project folder include:
    - `models/`, `data/`, `train.py`.
- Add `__main__.py` to run `python -m yourpkg train ...`.
- Unit-test a simple loss (pytest)
  
Remember, these are just the template tasks, you can modify things that best suit you.

- Now start by create an environment, install needed packages then export to an environment.yml file in the root folder
